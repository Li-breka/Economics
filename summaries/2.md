**Concise Summary:**

This lesson introduces fundamental economic concepts: economics (the study of choices in production, distribution, and consumption), goods and services, wants and needs, supply and demand, and markets. The lecture uses the Pilgrims' experience and a hypothetical island scenario to illustrate the importance of individual initiative and resourcefulness in economic systems. The discussion emphasizes that nothing is truly free and that all goods and services require effort and resources to produce.  The lesson concludes with a homework assignment and announcement of a reading quiz in the next class.


**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Economics Defined:** The study of choices made by individuals and societies regarding the production, distribution, and consumption of goods.  (PDC)

* **Goods vs. Services:**
    * **Goods:** Tangible items people desire and are willing to pay for (examples: food, clothing, tools, etc.).
    * **Services:** Intangible items produced by labor (examples: medical care, education, transportation, etc.).

* **Wants vs. Needs:**
    * **Wants:** Things people desire but can live without.
    * **Needs:** Things essential for survival.

* **Supply and Demand:**
    * **Supply:** The quantity of a good available at a given price under specific conditions (the amount produced).
    * **Demand:** The amount of a good consumers are willing and able to buy at a given price under specific conditions.
    *  Price and conditions affect both supply and demand.

* **Markets:** Any system for exchanging goods and services (examples: supermarkets, farmer's markets, stock markets, online marketplaces, etc.).

* **Economic Laws:**
    * Nothing is free; all goods and services require resources and effort.
    * Everyone is a consumer; not everyone is a producer, but all producers are consumers.
