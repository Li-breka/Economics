## Economics Class Notes: Diminishing Marginal Utility

## Concise Summary: 

This lecture explores the concept of diminishing marginal utility, which explains how the satisfaction derived from consuming a good decreases with each additional unit consumed.  The lesson uses real-life examples and scenarios to illustrate marginal utility, total utility, and the tactics businesses employ to capitalize on consumer behavior.

## Bulleted Outline:

* **Diminishing Marginal Value:**
    - People are less likely to work extra hours for the same overtime pay if their current income already provides a high level of satisfaction. 
    -  The additional satisfaction (marginal utility) from each extra dollar earned decreases as income increases.
* **Diminishing Marginal Utility:**
    - The satisfaction derived from consuming a good decreases with each additional unit consumed, even if the good itself remains the same.
    - **Example:** The satisfaction from eating a cheeseburger decreases with each additional burger consumed in a row.
* **Key Concepts:**
    - **Marginal Utility:** The satisfaction gained from consuming one additional unit of a good.
    - **Total Utility:** The total satisfaction gained from consuming a specific quantity of a good.
    - **Utility Schedule:** A table listing the marginal utility and total utility for different quantities of a good.
    - **Total Utility Curve:** A graph depicting the relationship between the total utility and the quantity of a good consumed. 
* **Business Tactics:**
    - Businesses utilize various strategies to influence consumer behavior and maximize profits, often exploiting the principle of diminishing marginal utility.
    - **Examples:** Large shopping carts, bulk purchase discounts, strategically placed goods, limited-time offers, and "buy one, get one" deals.
