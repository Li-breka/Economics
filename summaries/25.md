**Concise Summary:**

This lecture contrasts different economic systems, primarily focusing on free market economies versus command economies.  Key concepts covered include market signals, their absence in command economies leading to black markets, and the roles of the private and public sectors.  The lecture uses examples like prohibition and rationing to illustrate how governments can intervene in markets and the consequences, both intended and unintended.  Students are assigned homework reading and questions to further explore these concepts.

**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Market Signals and their Absence:**
    * Market signals are indicators of consumer preferences and needs used by producers to adjust supply and pricing.
    * Command economies lack effective market signals due to government control, resulting in inefficiencies, surpluses, shortages, and the rise of black markets.
    * Examples: Prohibition (alcohol black market), North Korea's camera pricing, rationing during wartime.

* **Black Markets:**
    * Develop as a response to government restrictions on buying and selling.
    * Characterized by illegal transactions, often with lower quality goods and price gouging.
    * Examples:  Prohibition-era speakeasies, illegal drug trade, organ trafficking.

* **Economic Systems:**
    * **Traditional Economy:** Economic decisions based on tradition and customs; little need for central planning (e.g., agrarian societies).
    * **Command Economy:** Centralized government controls production, distribution, and pricing; often leads to shortages and surpluses (e.g., North Korea).
    * **Free Market Economy:** Supply and demand determine production, distribution, and pricing; driven by market signals.
    * **Mixed Economy:** A blend of free market and government intervention (e.g., the United States).

* **Private vs. Public Sector:**
    * **Private Sector:** Businesses and individuals control economic activity.
    * **Public Sector:** Government controls economic activity.

* **Homework:**
    * Read "Economic Working Prosperity" pages 78-81 (up to "The Great Expectations Book Shop").
    * Answer questions 1-3 on page 86.
    * Upcoming test on chapters 4 and 5 in lesson 30.

**Definitions:**

* **Black Market:** An illegal system for exchanging goods to avoid governmental regulations.
