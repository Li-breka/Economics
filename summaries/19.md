## Economics Class Notes 

### Concise Summary: 

This lecture focuses on the fundamental economic principle of the Law of Supply. The class explored how the quantity of a good or service supplied is directly related to its price, assuming all other factors remain constant. Examples of pencils and lawn care services were used to illustrate how higher prices incentivize greater supply. The lecture differentiated between changes in quantity supplied, influenced solely by price, and changes in supply, which are impacted by factors like technology, resource prices, and government regulations. 

### Bulleted Outline: 

* **Law of Supply:**
    *  States that, all else being equal, as the price of a good increases, the quantity supplied also increases in a free market economy.
    *  This principle highlights the incentive for producers to supply more when prices are high, as it leads to higher potential profits.
* **Examples:**
    * **Pencils:** If the price of pencils skyrockets, suppliers will be motivated to find and sell more pencils due to the increased potential profit.
    * **Lawn care:**  If one neighborhood offers significantly higher prices for lawn care services, suppliers will be more inclined to offer services in that area over others. 
* **Quantity Supplied vs. Supply:**
    * **Change in Quantity Supplied:**  Affected **only** by changes in price. Higher prices lead to a higher quantity supplied, while lower prices lead to a lower quantity supplied.
    * **Change in Supply:** Impacted by factors other than price.  These factors include:
        * **Technology:**  Advancements in technology can increase efficiency and allow for greater supply at the same price. 
        * **Resource Prices:**  The cost of resources (labor, raw materials, etc.) influences production costs and therefore affects supply.
        * **Prices of Related Goods:** Changes in the prices of related goods (substitutes or complements) can impact the supply of a product.
        * **Number of Sellers:** More sellers in a market generally lead to increased competition and greater overall supply.
        * **Producer Expectations:**  Anticipated future market conditions can influence a producer's willingness to supply goods presently.
        * **Government Taxes, Subsidies, and Regulations:**  Government policies can influence production costs and incentives, affecting supply. For example:
            *  Taxes often increase production costs, potentially decreasing supply.
            *  Subsidies can incentivize production, potentially increasing supply. 
* **Supply Schedule and Curve:**
    * **Supply Schedule:** A table that lists the quantity of a good a supplier is willing to produce at various prices.
    * **Supply Curve:** A graphical representation of the supply schedule, showing the relationship between price and quantity supplied. It generally slopes upward to the right, reflecting the Law of Supply. 

### Homework: 

* Read "Economic Work and Prosperity" pages 62-64, up to "The Effects of a Change in Supply or Demand on Equilibrium."
* Complete questions 1-3 on page 66.
