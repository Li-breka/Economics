**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Homework Review:**
    * **Traveler's Checks vs. Personal Checks:** Traveler's checks are considered money because they function as a medium of exchange, a measure of value, and a store of value; personal checks are instructions to a bank and do not guarantee the availability of funds.
    * **Credit Cards and Net Worth:** Receiving a credit card does not increase net worth; it provides access to credit and the potential for debt.
    * **Importance of Good Credit Ratings:** Enables access to credit at favorable interest rates in emergencies; improves chances of loan approvals; facilitates large purchases (homes, cars).
    * **Avoiding Credit Trouble:** Setting spending limits; using credit cards responsibly (paying in full each month); creating a budget; understanding interest rates and fees.
