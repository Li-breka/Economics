**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Communism vs. Capitalism:**
    * **Communism:** An economic system based on public ownership and governmental control of resources.  Communism, often associated with Marxism, aims for complete equality of condition, achieved through the violent overthrow of the bourgeois (wealthy) by the proletariat (working class).
    * **Capitalism:** A free market system emphasizing private ownership, competition, and individual choice.

* **Karl Marx's Theories:**
    * **Class Warfare:** The conflict between the bourgeois (the wealthy) and the proletariat (the working class).  Marx believed this conflict was inevitable and would lead to a communist revolution.
    * **Dictatorship of the Proletariat:** A temporary transitional phase following the revolution, during which all property would be confiscated and opposition eliminated.
    * **Utopian Ideal:** Marx envisioned a communist society characterized by complete equality, communal living, and the absence of government or borders. His ideas ignored basic human nature.
    * **Das Kapital:** Marx's seminal work, in which he described capitalism as a necessary evil, a stepping stone to communism.
    * **Communist Manifesto:** A pamphlet outlining the theory and strategy for communist revolution.

* **Flaws in Marxist Ideology:**
    * Disregards human nature and individual ambition.
    * Historically proven to be inefficient and oppressive.
    * Results in widespread poverty and lack of freedom.
    * Seeks global domination through the spread of communist ideology.

* **Nationalism:** The promotion of one's own nation and government, often used as a tool by totalitarian regimes.  Important to distinguish from patriotism.

* **Socialism vs. Communism:**  Socialism seeks to achieve communist goals through peaceful means (voting), while communism uses violent revolution.
