**Concise Summary:**

This lesson examines the appropriate role of government in a free market economy, contrasting the views of Edmund Burke and John Maynard Keynes.  Key concepts discussed include the limitations of government intervention, the importance of individual responsibility, the consequences of deficit spending and national debt, and the different types of tax systems (progressive, regressive, proportional). The class analyzes the impact of government policies, specifically focusing on the New Deal and Keynesian economics, and discusses the potential dangers of excessive government intervention.  The lesson concludes with a homework assignment.


**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Government's Role in the Economy:**
    * **Edmund Burke's View:** Government's role is limited to maintaining public peace, safety, order, and prosperity; it cannot provide for individual needs.  Citizens, not the government, should provide for their own necessities.
    * **John Maynard Keynes' View:** Government intervention (Keynesian economics) is necessary during recessions to stimulate the economy through deficit spending and increased government programs. This approach is contrasted with the Austrian school of economics.

* **Taxation:**
    * **Progressive Tax:** Higher earners pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes (current US system).  This can discourage work ethic and economic advancement for those near higher tax brackets.
    * **Regressive Tax:** Lower earners pay a higher percentage of their income (e.g., sales tax on necessities).
    * **Proportional (Flat) Tax:** Everyone pays the same percentage, regardless of income.

* **National Debt and Deficit Spending:**
    * **National Debt:** The total amount of money owed by the government.
    * **Deficit Spending:** Spending more money than the government has, contributing to the national debt.
    * President Nixon's removal of the gold standard as a major contributor to increased debt.
    * Consequences of high national debt include economic instability and diminished international standing.
    * Difficulty in reducing debt stems from political pressures and the unpopularity of cutting government programs.

* **The New Deal and Keynesian Economics:**
    * FDR's New Deal involved government spending and increased regulations to combat the Great Depression.
    * Keynesian economics advocates for government intervention to stimulate demand during economic downturns.  The long-term consequences of sustained government intervention are questioned.

* **Government Growth and Bureaucracy:**
    * Increased government involvement in the economy leads to a larger bureaucracy and greater regulation.  This shift is illustrated with statistics on the number of public employees over time.
    *  The example of an attorney's office, requiring diverse support staff, is used to illustrate the growth of government services and support infrastructure.


* **Homework Assignment:**
