## Concise Summary:

This class session explored the concept of monopolies and the role of government regulation in a free market economy.  The discussion focused on how monopolies can negatively impact consumers by driving up prices and lowering quality, and how collusion between businesses can also harm competition. The class then examined the Sherman Act of 1890 and the Clayton Act, both designed to combat monopolies and trust agreements. The lecture also covered the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), its role in protecting consumers from fraud and identity theft, and examples of government intervention in the free market. Finally, the class discussed the necessity of government regulation in certain situations, such as when national security, consumer safety, or the public good are at risk.
