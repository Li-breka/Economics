**Concise Summary:**

This lesson delves into business cycles, exploring their characteristics (expansion, peak, recession, trough) and causes.  The discussion analyzes the impact of unemployment compensation, the relationship between wartime economies and post-war recessions, and the role of seasonal businesses in economic fluctuations.  Different types of business organizations (from 11B) are reviewed. Key terms like GDP and GNP are defined and differentiated. The lecture concludes with a homework assignment focusing on further reading and questions related to business cycles.

**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Business Cycles:**
    * Defined by periods of expansion, peak, recession, and trough.  Each cycle includes all four phases.
    * Factors influencing business cycles include seasonal demand (e.g., holiday shopping, tourism), interest rates, and wartime economies.
    *  Examples of businesses with fluctuating sales: housing market (influenced by interest rates), seasonal businesses (clothing, flowers, fireworks, greeting cards), etc.
    * Leading indicators predict changes in the economy before they happen (e.g., construction, interest rates).

* **Unemployment Compensation:**
    * Generous unemployment benefits can disincentivize work, reduce the labor supply, and increase the tax burden on employed workers.

* **Wartime Economies and Post-War Recessions:**
    * Wartime economies often experience expansion due to increased demand for goods and services.
    * Post-war periods may see recessions due to decreased government spending, reduced demand, and the need for economic transition.

* **Recession:**
    * Defined as two or more consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, or a significant decline in economic activity lasting more than a few months.
    * Companies lay off workers during recessions due to reduced demand and the need to cut costs.

* **GDP vs. GNP:**
    * **GDP (Gross Domestic Product):** The value of all finished goods and services produced *within a country's borders*.
    * **GNP (Gross National Product):** The value of all finished goods and services produced by a nation's citizens, regardless of location (largely replaced by GDP).

* **Review of Business Organizations (from 11B):**
    * Sole proprietorship.
    * Partnership.
    * Corporation (C corp & S corp).
    * LLC (Limited Liability Company).


* **Homework Assignment:**
    * Read "Economic Work and Prosperity," pages 187-189 (up to "Selfishness and Envy").
    * Answer questions 1-3 on page 189.
    * Read Economic Supplement Application 11D.
