**Concise Summary:**

This lesson examines inflation, differentiating between demand-pull and cost-push inflation, and introducing stagflation as a combination of high inflation and high unemployment.  The discussion analyzes the impact of government policies, particularly supply-side economics under President Reagan, in addressing stagflation in the 1970s. The role of the consumer price index (CPI) and base periods in measuring inflation is explained, along with the significant impact of the 1973 oil crisis. The lecture concludes with a homework assignment focusing on further reading and questions related to inflation and economic policies.

**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Inflation:**
    * **Demand-Pull Inflation:** Prices rise due to increased demand exceeding supply (e.g., hurricane preparedness supplies).
    * **Cost-Push Inflation:** Prices rise due to increased production costs (e.g., minimum wage increases).
    * **CPI (Consumer Price Index):** Measures changes in the price of consumer goods and services over time.  The base period (1982-1984) is used as a benchmark (100%).
    * **Base Period:** The period against which price changes are measured.

* **Stagflation:**
    * A combination of high inflation and high unemployment, resulting in stagnant economic growth.
    * Experienced in the 1970s (Carter administration).

* **Supply-Side Economics:**
    * Implemented under President Reagan to combat stagflation.
    * Involves lowering taxes to stimulate business investment, job creation, and economic growth.
    * Potential drawbacks include reduced government revenue and the need to cut spending in other areas.

* **1973 Oil Crisis:**
    *  President Nixon's removal from the gold standard, combined with OPEC's oil embargo against the US, significantly impacted global inflation.  The increase in oil prices led to a rise in the prices of goods and services worldwide.


* **Government's Role in Inflation:**
    * Milton Friedman's assertion that inflation is a form of taxation without legislation.
    *  Government policies, such as printing more money or excessive spending, can contribute to inflation.


* **Homework Assignment:**
    * Read "Economic Work and Prosperity," pages 189-191.
    * Answer questions 1-3 on page 191.
    * Read Economic Supplement Application 11E.
