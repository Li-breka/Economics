**Concise Summary:**

This lecture explores the history of economic thought, contrasting mercantilism and physiocracy.  Key differences between these schools of thought are highlighted, focusing on their views of wealth (gold vs. natural resources), the role of government (interventionist vs. laissez-faire), and international trade (protectionism vs. free trade). The lecture also introduces core economic concepts like the Diamond-Water Paradox, scarcity, utility, and the four factors of production (to be detailed later).  Homework includes assigned readings and questions.

**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Laws of Economics vs. Government Laws:**
    * Laws of economics are general principles governing economic activity; violating them doesn't carry legal penalties.
    * Government laws regulate or prohibit specific actions; violating them results in legal consequences.

* **Limitations on Production:**
    * Every society faces natural limits on its capacity to produce goods due to geographic and resource constraints.
    * Example: Florida's inability to produce wheat or operate ski resorts.

* **Diamond-Water Paradox:**
    * Solved by Carl Menger of the Austrian School of Economics.
    * Explains that value is determined by both scarcity and utility (usefulness).  In a desert, water is more valuable than diamonds despite diamonds' higher market price in more developed areas.

* **Mercantilism:**
    * Believed a nation's wealth is determined by its gold reserves.
    * Advocated for government intervention, tariffs, and colonial exploitation to maintain a favorable trade balance (exporting more than importing).
    * Practice of imperialism to expand colonial holdings and increase wealth.

* **Physiocracy:**
    * Emphasized natural resources (particularly agriculture) as the source of wealth.
    * Advocated for laissez-faire economics (minimal government intervention).
    * Believed free markets and free trade would lead to greater prosperity.

* **Core Economic Concepts:**
    * **Scarcity:** The limited availability of resources.
    * **Utility:** The usefulness or satisfaction derived from a good or service.
    * **Four Factors of Production:** (To be covered in Chapter 3)  Land, labor, capital, entrepreneurship.  The instructor mentions a possible fifth factor, but only four are emphasized.
    * **Capital:** Goods used in the production of other goods.

* **In Affluent Societies:** Scarcity often holds more value than utility (example: collectible baseball cards).

* **Homework:**
    * Read "Economic Works and Prosperity" pages 21-24 (up to "Ways to Prosperity").
    * Answer questions 1-3 on page 24.
    * Prepare a current event for the next lesson.
    * Read supplement application 2.
