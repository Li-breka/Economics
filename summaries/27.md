## Lesson Notes: Opportunity Cost and Production Possibilities

**Concise Summary:** This lesson focuses on economic concepts, specifically opportunity cost and production possibilities curves (PPC). The class reviews definitions of key terms like depreciation, opportunity cost, wage of management, and equity. They then explore the concept of PPC using a hypothetical scenario of a farmer choosing between growing soybeans and corn. The lesson highlights the importance of considering opportunity cost when making production decisions and emphasizes the law of increasing costs. Finally, the class analyzes a case study of Mrs. Moner's bookstore, demonstrating how opportunity cost can impact perceived profit or loss. 

**Bulleted Outline:**

**Key Economic Concepts:**

* **Depreciation:** The diminishing of the value of goods over time and due to location.
* **Opportunity Cost:** The value of the best alternative that is foregone when a different alternative is chosen. 
* **Wage of Management:** The wage that a business owner would need to pay someone else to manage their business.
* **Equity:** The total value of a business minus any liabilities.

**Production Possibilities Curve (PPC):**

* **Definition:** A graph that shows the different combinations of two goods that can be produced with a given set of resources.
* **Key Considerations:**
    * **Scarcity:** Resources are limited, forcing choices.
    * **Opportunity Cost:** Choosing one product means giving up another.
    * **Efficiency:** Finding the optimal balance of production to maximize output.
* **Types of PPC:**
    * **Expanding Economy:** Curve shifts outward, representing increased resources or efficiency.
    * **Retracting Economy:** Curve shifts inward, representing decreased resources or efficiency.
    * **Straight Line:** Production of both goods is equally efficient, suggesting equal opportunity costs.
    * **Curve Bending Inward:** Production of one good hinders production of the other, resulting in decreasing opportunity costs. 
* **Law of Increasing Costs:** The opportunity cost of one product increases as more of the other product is produced. 

**Case Study: Mrs. Moner's Bookstore:**

* **Revenue:** $741,900.
* **Expenses:** 
    * Actual: $26,000 (depreciation).
    * Economically calculated: $26,000 + $107,000 (opportunity cost). 
* **Profit:**
    * Actual: $741,900 - $26,000 = $715,900.
    * Economically calculated: $741,900 - ($26,000 + $107,000) = $608,900. 

**Homework:**

* Read pages 84-86 in the textbook.
* Complete questions 6-8 on page 86.
* Read Economic Supplement Application 5D. 

**Definitions/Formulas (Optional):**

* **PPC:** Production Possibilities Curve. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Value of the best alternative foregone. 
* **Law of Increasing Costs:** Opportunity cost of one product rises as more of the other is produced.
