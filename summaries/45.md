**III.  Inflation**

* **Definition:**  Inflation is the decrease in the purchasing power of money.
* **Causes:**
    * **Printing Excess Money:** When governments print too much money, the value of money decreases. 
    * **Scarcity and Supply of Goods and Services:** When goods and services are scarce, prices increase.
    * **Increased Cost of Production:**  When costs of production increase, such as labor costs, the price of goods and services also increases.
* **Effects:**
    * **Decreased Buying Power:**  Inflation erodes the value of money, meaning that you need more money to buy the same goods and services. 
    * **Increased Costs for Creditors:**  Creditors lose money because of inflation, as the value of the money they are repaid is less than the value of the money they loaned. 
    * **Increased Costs for Those with Fixed Income:**  Retired individuals who receive fixed pensions lose buying power as the cost of living increases.
