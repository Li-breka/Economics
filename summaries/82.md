**Concise Summary:**

This class is a review session for the final exam, focusing on chapters 1-4 of the textbook and its supplement.  The review takes the form of a competitive game ("us vs. them") where students answer questions on key economic concepts.  The game covers fundamental economic principles, including supply and demand, factors of production, different economic systems, and the role of morality in economics. The session ends with a discussion of productivity and market wages before assigning homework for the next class.
