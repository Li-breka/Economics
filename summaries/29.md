## Concise Summary:

This lesson covers key concepts from chapters 4 and 5 of an economics textbook, focusing on supply, demand, and market dynamics. The class engages in a lively review game, where students answer questions related to these topics. The game highlights important concepts such as diminishing marginal utility, elasticity of demand, and the role of substitutes and complements in the market. Additionally, the lesson explores the factors that influence wage equilibrium and productivity, as well as the production possibilities curve (PPC).

## Bulleted Outline:

**I. Review of Chapters 4 & 5 (Supply and Demand)**

- **Key Concepts:**
    - Supply: The relationship between a good's price and the amount producers are willing to provide.
    - Demand: The relationship between a good's price and the amount consumers are willing to buy.
    - Diminishing Marginal Utility: The decrease in satisfaction from consuming each additional unit of a good.
    - Total Utility: The total satisfaction derived from consuming a specific quantity of a good.
    - Elasticity of Demand: The responsiveness of demand to changes in price.
    - Substitutes: Goods that can be used in place of another.
    - Complements: Goods that are often used together.
    - Equilibrium: The point where quantity demanded and quantity supplied are equal.
    - Shortage: When quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied.
    - Surplus: When quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded.

- **Factors Affecting Demand:**
    - Taste and Preferences
    - Income
    - Price of Related Goods (Substitutes and Complements)
    - Population
    - Expectations

- **Factors Affecting Supply:**
    - Price of Inputs
    - Technology
    - Number of Sellers
    - Government Regulations
    - Expectations
    - Natural Events

- **Government Interventions:**
    - Price Ceilings: Maximum prices set by the government.
    - Price Floors: Minimum prices set by the government.
    - Subsidies: Government payments to encourage production.
    - Rent Control: A form of price ceiling on rental rates.

**II. Wage Equilibrium and Productivity**

- **Wage Equilibrium:** The point where supply and demand for labor are equal, determining wages.
- **Productivity:** The efficiency of resource use in production.
- **Factors Affecting Wage Equilibrium:**
    - Supply and Demand for Labor
    - Competition
    - Government Regulations

**III. Production Possibilities Curve (PPC)**

- **PPC:** A graph illustrating the maximum combinations of two goods that can be produced with available resources.
- **Shifts in PPC:**
    - Outward Shift: Indicates economic growth due to technological advancements, increased resources, etc.
    - Inward Shift: Indicates a decrease in production capacity.

**IV. Profits and Business**

- **Factors Affecting Profits:**
    - Business Expenses (taxes, wages, utilities, etc.)
    - Competition
    - Market Demand

**V. Homework Assignment:**

- Study Chapters 4, 5, and supplemental materials for an upcoming test.
- Review concepts related to purchasing a car, college selection, and economic futures.
