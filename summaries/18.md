## Class Notes: The Law of Demand and Factors Affecting Demand

**Concise Summary:** This economics lesson reviewed factors influencing demand for goods and services. Key concepts included the law of demand, income and substitution effects, the difference between changes in quantity demanded versus changes in demand, and how these are visually represented through demand curves. 

**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Homework Review:**
    * Discussed how changes in price influence consumer choices, using examples like food (beef vs. beans) and gasoline consumption.
    * Examined how dramatic events (e.g., weather) can lead to significant shifts in demand for certain goods.
* **Psychological Tactics in Business:**
    * Reviewed tactics used by businesses to influence consumer behavior and increase sales. 
        * Examples: BOGO deals, product placement for impulse buys, manipulating purchase limits, removing dollar signs from menus, and larger shopping carts.
* **Diminishing Marginal Utility:**
    * Defined marginal utility: The satisfaction gained from each additional unit of a good decreases as more units are consumed.
    * Explained total utility: The total satisfaction from consuming a specific quantity of a good.
* **Law of Demand:**
    * Defined the Law of Demand: As the price of a good increases, the quantity demanded decreases, assuming all other factors remain constant.
    * Emphasized the importance of considering the time frame when analyzing demand.
    * Used examples to illustrate the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded.
* **Income Effect:**
    * Defined Income Effect: When the price of a good decreases, consumers can buy more of that good or other goods without an increase in income.
    * Explained that a decrease in price increases purchasing power, even though income hasn't changed.
* **Substitution Effect:**
    * Defined Substitution Effect: Consumers tend to replace goods that have become more expensive with less expensive alternatives.
    * Illustrated this effect using the examples of switching to generic brands or choosing less expensive food options.
* **Demand Schedule and Demand Curve:**
    * Explained Demand Schedule: A table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded.
    * Explained Demand Curve: A graphical representation of the demand schedule, with price on the vertical axis and quantity demanded on the horizontal axis.
    * Emphasized that the demand curve slopes downward and to the right, illustrating the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded.
* **Changes in Demand vs. Changes in Quantity Demanded:**
    * **Change in Quantity Demanded:**  Movement along the demand curve caused only by a change in the price of the good.
    * **Change in Demand:** A shift of the entire demand curve caused by factors other than price.
* **Five Factors that Shift the Demand Curve:**
    * **1. Tastes and Preferences:** Changes in consumer preferences can lead to an increase or decrease in demand.
    * **2. Income:**  Changes in income levels influence the types and quantities of goods consumers demand (normal goods vs. inferior goods).
    * **3. Population:** Changes in population size affect the overall demand for goods and services in a market. 
    * **4. Prices of Related Goods:** Changes in the prices of substitute goods (alternatives) or complementary goods (used together) can influence demand.
    * **5. Consumer Expectations:** Expectations about future prices, availability, or needs can impact current demand.
