### Bulleted Outline:

**I. Mercantilism vs. Physiocrats & Adam Smith**

* **Mercantilism:** A nation's wealth is based on its accumulation of gold. Colonies exist to benefit the mother country through policies like tariffs.
    *  Promotes government regulation and control over the economy. 
* **Physiocrats:** Believed in "laissez-faire" economics â€“ minimal government intervention.
    * Argued that a nation's wealth is based on its natural resources and their productive use.

    *  Introduced the concept of the "invisible hand" guiding self-interested individuals to benefit society.

**II. Key Concepts**

* **Division of Labor:** Dividing production into specialized tasks increases efficiency and output (e.g., different roles on a football team or within a restaurant).
