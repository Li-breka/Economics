**Concise Summary:**

This lesson covered the economic concept of money, contrasting different historical forms of currency (e.g., salt, rifle cartridges, pine tree shillings) and exploring the characteristics of effective monetary systems.  The discussion included a hypothetical investment scenario to illustrate the power of compounding, and the use of a paperclip as a hypothetical currency ("Ren") to illustrate the functions of money (medium of exchange, measure of value, store of value). The six key characteristics of effective money (portability, durability, homogeneity, divisibility, constancy, intrinsic valuableness) were explained and compared across different examples.  Homework involved reading about the history of money and completing a rough draft of the research paper.

**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Homework Review:** Analysis of advantages and disadvantages of using salt and rifle cartridges as currency; explanation of why bartering proved unsatisfactory for Massachusetts colonists; analysis of a hypothetical government contract for printing money.

* **The Nature of Money:**
    * Definition: Anything generally accepted as a means of payment.
    * Functions: medium of exchange, measure of value, store of value.
    * Hypothetical Currency ("Ren"):  A paperclip used to illustrate the functions and challenges of establishing a currency.  Discussion of the importance of stability and value in a currency.
    * Historical Examples:  Limestone wheels (Yap), pine tree shillings (Massachusetts).

* **Characteristics of Effective Money:**
    * Portability: Easily transportable.
    * Durability: Resistant to wear and tear.
    * Homogeneity: Standardized appearance and recognition.
    * Divisibility: Easily divided into smaller units.
    * Constancy: Stable value over time.
    * Intrinsic Valuableness: Possesses inherent value beyond its function as currency.

* **Comparison of Currency:** Comparison of the Ren, the American dollar, and historical currencies based on the six characteristics of effective money.  Discussion of the challenges of bartering as a system of exchange.

* **Investment Principles:**  Discussion of a hypothetical investment scenario to illustrate compounding; the importance of time in investment strategies.  Types of stock (common vs. preferred) and bonds.  Mutual funds as a diversified investment strategy.  The concept of risk versus reward in investment decisions.

* **Homework:**
    * Read pages 145-151 of the economics textbook (up to "The Money Supply").
    * Answer questions 3, 3, 5 on page 147 and questions 1, 3, 5 on page 151.
    * Complete the rough draft of the research paper.
