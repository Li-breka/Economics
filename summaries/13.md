## Economics Class Notes 

### Concise Summary:
This lecture focuses on the three fundamental components of capitalism: property rights, freedom of enterprise and competition within a market environment, and limited government. The lecture emphasizes the importance of private property, encompassing tangible goods, land, finances, and intellectual property. It highlights how competition within a free market, guided by Adam Smith's "invisible hand," leads to innovation and efficient resource allocation. Lastly, the lecture stresses the necessity of limited government intervention in a capitalist system to foster economic prosperity.

### Bulleted Outline:
**I.  Three Basic Components of Capitalism**

   * **Property Rights**
      -  Essential for order and preventing anarchy.
      -  Encompass tangible goods, real estate (land and buildings), financial assets, and intellectual property.
      -  **Types of Property:**
          * **Tangible:** Physical possessions (e.g., toothbrush, car).
          * **Real:** Land and buildings.
          * **Financial:**  Cash, savings, investments. 
          * **Intellectual:** Creations of the mind (e.g., songs, inventions, software).
   * **Freedom of Enterprise and Competition in a Market Environment**
      - Individuals can use their property as they see fit within a framework of regulations to protect the public.
      - Competition, driven by self-interest, guides efficient resource allocation (invisible hand).
      - Monopolies can exist, but competition generally fosters innovation and better products. 
   * **Limited Government**
      - Excessive government control stifles innovation and individual freedom.
      - Limited government allows for the free market to thrive while still providing necessary regulations. 

**II. The Market System**

   * **Two Key Components:**
      - **Resource Market:** Where businesses acquire factors of production (natural resources, labor, capital, entrepreneurship).
      - **Product Market:** Where businesses sell finished goods and services to households.
   * **Circular Flow Model:** Illustrates the interconnectedness of households and businesses.
      - Households provide factors of production to businesses.
      - Businesses pay for those factors, providing income to households.
      - Households use that income to purchase goods and services from businesses.

**III. Examples and Supporting Ideas**

   * The DuPont Company exemplifies entrepreneurship, risk-taking, and innovation within a capitalist system.
   * Leonard E. Read's essay "I, Pencil" illustrates how the invisible hand and a complex web of interactions within a free market result in the creation of a seemingly simple product.
   * Patents and copyrights, while temporarily limiting competition, encourage innovation by protecting intellectual property rights.

**IV. Homework Assignment:**

   * Study Chapters 1-3 of the textbook for Test 1 in Lesson 15.
   * Answer specific questions on pages 16, 27, and 48.
