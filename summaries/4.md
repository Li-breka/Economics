**Concise Summary:**

This lesson explores the economic concepts of needs, wants, and value.  The lecture differentiates needs (necessities for survival) from wants (desires), highlighting that what people want is not always what they need. The discussion examines the diamond-water paradox, illustrating how the value of a good is determined by both its utility (usefulness) and its scarcity. The role of scarcity and utility in determining value is further explored using examples from various cultures and economic contexts. The lesson concludes with a homework assignment.


**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Needs vs. Wants:**
    * **Needs:** Essential for survival (food, shelter, clothing).
    * **Wants:** Desirable but not essential (luxury goods, entertainment, etc.).
    *  The distinction between needs and wants is subjective and depends on individual circumstances and cultural factors.

* **Value:** Determined by both utility and scarcity.
    * **Utility:** Usefulness or level of satisfaction a good provides.
    * **Scarcity:** The limited availability of a good.
    * The diamond-water paradox illustrates that something scarce (diamonds) can be more valuable than something essential (water) depending on relative scarcity and utility.

* **The Role of Scarcity:**  Even in affluent societies, scarcity plays a significant role in determining value, with people often prioritizing scarce items over abundant necessities.

* **Income Inequality:** The existence of income inequality is acknowledged, but it is argued that this does not necessarily imply injustice or exploitation.  Opportunities for upward mobility exist in free market systems.

* **Marx's Labor Theory of Value:**  This theory posits that the value of a good is determined solely by the amount of labor put into it.  This theory is shown to be insufficient as a comprehensive explanation of value, as it ignores scarcity and utility.

* **Homework Assignment:**
    * Read pages 17-20 of "Economic Work and Prosperity."
    * Answer questions 1-2 on page 18 and questions 3-5 on page 20.
    * Study for a quiz on Chapter 1.
