**Concise Summary:**

This lesson explores globalization and its implications, examining both its advantages (increased trade, international cooperation) and disadvantages (loss of national sovereignty, dependency). The discussion uses the Tower of Babel as a historical analogy, contrasting humanity's desire for unity with God's command for dispersion.  The lecture also analyzes the structure and potential limitations of the United Nations, including the General Assembly and Security Council, and discusses various international organizations involved in global economic and social issues (World Bank, IMF, WTO). The lesson concludes with a homework assignment.


**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Globalization:**  The increasing interconnectedness of nations through trade, communication, and cultural exchange.
    * **Advantages:** Increased trade and economic growth; opportunities for international cooperation on shared challenges (scientific research, environmental protection).
    * **Disadvantages:** Loss of national sovereignty; potential economic dependency on other nations; challenges in enforcing international agreements and resolving conflicts.

* **Tower of Babel Analogy:**  The Tower of Babel story in Genesis is presented as a cautionary tale about humanity's ambition for global unity without God. God's scattering of humanity is contrasted with the modern drive toward globalization.


* **The United Nations (UN):**  An international organization established to promote peace and cooperation among nations.
    * **General Assembly:** Each member nation receives one vote, regardless of size or population, which can lead to inequities.
    * **Security Council:** Five permanent members (US, UK, France, China, Russia) with veto power, which can hinder effective action.
    * **Limitations:** Challenges in enforcing peace and resolving conflicts; potential for bias and political maneuvering.
