**Concise Summary:**

This lesson examines the infiltration of socialism and its consequences, using examples from Sweden and Canada.  The discussion contrasts the benefits promised by socialized programs (e.g., extensive paid parental leave in Sweden) with their potential negative impacts (high taxes, loss of individual freedom, economic inefficiencies). The lecture also addresses rent control and government intervention in pricing, highlighting the unintended negative consequences for both landlords and tenants.  The lesson concludes with a homework assignment focusing on review for an upcoming test.

**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Socialism's Infiltration:**
    * Defined as collective ownership and control of national resources.
    * Examples of socialist policies: extensive paid parental leave (Sweden), government-run healthcare (Canada).
    *  Potential problems: high taxes, economic inefficiencies, loss of individual freedom, unintended consequences of government intervention.

* **Sweden's Socialist Policies:**
    * Extensive paid parental leave (13 months).
    * Five weeks paid vacation.
    * Unemployment benefits ($700/week, regardless of job search).

    * Government control of media and industries.  High income tax rate (57%).

* **Canada's Socialized Healthcare:**

* **Rent Control (Santa Monica Example):**
    * Rent control in Santa Monica prevents landlords from raising rent to keep pace with inflation.
    * Negative consequences for both landlords (reduced income, disincentive to maintain properties) and tenants (potential for reduced property maintenance and availability).

* **Government Price Controls (Meat Example):**
    * Attempt to control meat prices by mandating 1990 price levels.
