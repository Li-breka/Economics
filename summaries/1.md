**Concise Summary:**

This lesson introduces the concept of economics as the study of choices individuals and societies make regarding the production, distribution, and consumption of goods (PDC). The lecture uses the example of the Pilgrims' early experience in Jamestown to illustrate the failure of communal ownership and the success of a free market system.  The importance of individual responsibility, wise resource management, and the role of morality in economic prosperity are highlighted.  The lesson concludes with a homework assignment focusing on the early chapters of the textbook.


**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Economics Defined:** The study of choices individuals and societies make in the production, distribution, and consumption of goods (PDC).

* **The Importance of Economics:**  All societies, regardless of complexity, require some economic system to meet basic needs (food, clothing, shelter, defense).

* **Why Economic Disparities Exist:**  Differences in prosperity result from how individuals and nations use their resources.  Some prioritize saving and investing, while others focus on consumption.

* **The Pilgrims' Experience in Jamestown:**  The Pilgrims' initial attempt at a communal economic system (communism) failed due to lack of individual incentive.  Switching to a free market system led to significantly improved outcomes.  This exemplifies the importance of individual initiative and private property rights in economic success.
