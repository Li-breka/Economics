## Concise Summary:

This lecture explores the concept of government intervention in a free market, specifically focusing on price controls and minimum wage. The discussion examines how rent control and minimum wage laws can create unintended consequences, leading to shortages, reduced quality of goods and services, and potential job losses. The lecture emphasizes the importance of understanding basic economic principles like supply and demand, equilibrium, and market value when considering government policies.

## Bulleted Outline:

**I. Government Intervention in Free Markets**

* **Price Controls:**
    * **Price Ceiling:** A government-imposed maximum price on a good or service, which can lead to shortages (e.g., rent control).
    * **Price Floor:** A government-imposed minimum price on a good or service, which can lead to surpluses (e.g., minimum wage).

**II. Rent Control**

* **Effects of Rent Control:**
    * **Shortages:** Lower rents can lead to more demand for apartments, exceeding the supply.
    * **Reduced Quality:** Landlords may be forced to reduce maintenance, amenities, and services to offset lower rents.
    * **Disincentive for New Construction:** Lower rents make it less profitable to build new apartments.

**III. Minimum Wage**

* **Effects of Minimum Wage:**
    * **Job Losses:** Higher minimum wages can incentivize businesses to automate or reduce their workforce.
    * **Reduced Hours:** Businesses may reduce worker hours to offset increased labor costs.
    * **Disincentive for Entry-Level Workers:**  Minimum wage jobs may not offer sufficient compensation to attract workers seeking more substantial careers.

**IV. Economic Principles**

* **Supply and Demand:**  The interaction between the availability of goods and services and consumer demand determines equilibrium prices.
* **Equilibrium:** The point where supply and demand intersect, representing a price at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded.
* **Market Value:** The price determined by the forces of supply and demand in an open, competitive market.

**V. Additional Points**

* **Substitution:** Consumers may choose alternative goods or services when the price of their desired good becomes too high.
* **Diminishing Marginal Utility:** The satisfaction derived from consuming a good or service decreases as consumption increases.
* **Fair Labor Standards Act (1938):** Established a federal minimum wage.
* **Worker Productivity:** The amount of goods and services produced by a worker in a given amount of time.

## Definitions/Formulas:

* **Equilibrium:** The point where supply and demand intersect, resulting in a price at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded.
