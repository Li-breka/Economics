This lesson uses the allegory of "The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs" to illustrate the dangers of excessive government intervention in the economy. The lecture examines a case study of a fictional company facing financial difficulties due to government regulations and union demands, highlighting the negative consequences of policies that stifle business growth and individual initiative.  The discussion also explores the historical failures of command economies and the importance of a free market system with moral incentives for long-term economic prosperity. The lesson concludes with a homework assignment.


**Bulleted Outline:**

* **The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs:** This allegory represents the relationship between government and the private sector.  Excessive demands from the government (like the couple's greed) destroy the source of wealth (the goose/private sector).

* **Case Study: Gray Iron Fabricating Company:** This fictional company's struggles illustrate the negative impact of government regulations (OSHA fines), union demands (high wages), and lawsuits on a business's ability to thrive.  The company's declining profitability leads to layoffs, reduced dividends, and ultimately, financial ruin.  This illustrates the unintended consequences of excessive government intervention and the need for a balanced approach.

* **Options Facing Gray Iron Fabricating:**
    * Secure a bank loan (risky due to high interest rates).
    * Terminate union contracts (risks strikes and work stoppages).
    * Sell the company to a larger corporation (loss of control).
    * Go out of business.
    * Outsource production to a lower-cost location (potential negative effects on local employment).

* **Excessive Government Intervention:**  The lesson highlights how excessive taxation, regulations, and government mandates can stifle economic growth, lead to job losses, and ultimately destroy the very businesses they are intended to protect.  The example of OSHA overreach in the case study is given.

* **Importance of Moral Incentives:** The lesson emphasizes that a free market economy requires moral incentives (individual responsibility, hard work, honesty) to flourish.  The importance of allowing businesses to succeed and fail based on market forces is stressed.

* **Homework Assignment:**
    * Read pages 231-233 of "Economic Work and Prosperity."
