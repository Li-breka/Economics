**Concise Summary:**

This class lecture focuses on market signals and their impact on supply and demand.  The instructor uses several examples, including insulation, books, clothes pens, and cars, to illustrate how consumer choices (or lack thereof) influence producer decisions on pricing and inventory.  The discussion also covers price floors, price ceilings, and the differences between durable and non-durable goods, highlighting the role of consumer demand in a free market economy.  Finally, the lecture touches upon the practical considerations of large purchases like cars, emphasizing wise financial decision-making.


**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Market Signals:**
    * Defined as signs used by consumers and producers to determine how much of a good to buy or sell at a given price.
    * Examples:
        * Mr. Court of Machia declining expensive insulation (signals low demand at that price).
        * Ola Swenson's criticism of a bookstore's selection (signals unmet demand for certain books).
        * High demand for clothes pens leading to their discontinuation due to supply difficulties.
        * Lack of demand for a certain cake mix leading to its discontinuation.

* **Price Floors and Ceilings:**
    * **Price Floor:** A minimum price set by the government, resulting in a surplus (e.g., minimum wage).
    * **Price Ceiling:** A maximum price set by the government, resulting in a shortage (e.g., rent control).

* **Durable vs. Non-Durable Goods:**
    * **Durable Goods:**  Expected lifespan exceeding three years (e.g., refrigerators).
    * **Non-Durable Goods:** Expected lifespan of less than three years (e.g., milk, cake mix).

* **Consumer Influence in a Free Market:**
    * Consumers ultimately determine what goods are produced and at what quality through their purchasing decisions and market signals.
    * Producers react to these signals by adjusting prices, inventory, and product offerings.

* **Large Purchases and Financial Prudence:**
    * The lecture emphasizes the importance of careful consideration before making significant purchases (cars, houses).
    * Advice includes researching used cars thoroughly (history reports, mechanic inspection), avoiding impulse buys, and considering the long-term financial implications.


* **Homework:**
    * Read "Economic Working Prosperity" pages 76-77.
    * Complete questions 1-2 and 5-6 on page 78.
    * Read economic supplement application 5B.
