The lecture also critiques the argument for global aid from industrially advanced countries (IACs) to less developed countries (LDCs), highlighting the potential for dependency and inefficiency. The lesson concludes with a homework assignment.


**Bulleted Outline:**

* **UN's Failure to Maintain World Peace:**
    * The UN lacks the authority and ability to control global conflicts effectively due to its structure (veto power in the Security Council) and inherent limitations in addressing human nature.
    * Reducing military capabilities of moral nations would likely embolden aggressive nations, increasing conflict.  Peace through strength is argued as a necessary deterrent.

* **Humanitarian Aid:**
    * **Critique of Global Aid Organizations:** Ineffective due to creating dependency on aid, subsidizing irresponsible governments, and lacking accountability.  Private charities are presented as a more effective alternative.
    * **Moral Responsibility:** While individuals and nations have a moral responsibility to help the poor, this should be done through effective and accountable channels, primarily private charities.
    * **Industrially Advanced Countries (IACs) and Less Developed Countries (LDCs):**  The argument that IACs have a moral obligation to provide financial aid to LDCs is challenged due to the potential for misuse of funds and the creation of dependency.

* **Accountability:** The lack of accountability in many international aid organizations leads to inefficiency and the misuse of funds.  This is contrasted with the accountability expected in private businesses and organizations.

* **Homework Assignment:**
    * Read pages 215-218 of "Economic Work and Prosperity."
    * Answer questions 6-8 on page 219.
    * Read Economic Supplement Application 13B.
