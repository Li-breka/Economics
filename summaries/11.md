### Bulleted Outline:

* **Defining Capital:**
    *  Capital does NOT equal money in economics.
    *  Capital refers to tangible producer goods used to create products or provide services.
    *  Examples: Tools, machinery, factories, etc.
* **Capitalists:**
    *  Individuals or entities who own producer goods or a share of a business that uses them.
    *  Investing in stocks and bonds makes one a capitalist because the funds contribute to businesses that produce goods.
* **Importance of Capital:**
    *  Crucial for economic growth and prosperity.
    *  Allows for the production of consumer goods, raising living standards.
    *  Societies with limited capital often struggle with poverty (subsistence economies).
* **Private vs. State Capitalism:**
    *  **Private Capitalism:** The majority of capital is owned and controlled by private individuals or entities. 
        *  Typically leads to greater efficiency, innovation, and wealth creation.
    *  **State Capitalism:** The majority of capital is owned and controlled by the government.
        *  Can lead to inefficiencies, shortages, and slower economic growth.
* **Examples:**
    *  Samantha Swenson, a highly-paid executive, is not considered a capitalist because she doesn't own a share of the restaurant business she manages.
    *  Robinson Crusoe's survival after being shipwrecked hinged on the tools (capital) he salvaged, highlighting their value over money in a crisis.
* **Key Takeaway:**  Capital, distinct from money, is the engine of economic prosperity. Private ownership and control of capital generally lead to more favorable economic outcomes.
