**Concise Summary:**

This lesson explored the history and characteristics of money, focusing on different types of currency and the economic consequences of inflation and deflation.  The discussion included historical examples (salt, rifle cartridges, pine tree shillings, gold coins), hypothetical scenarios to illustrate investment principles and the functions of money, and an explanation of Gresham's Law ("bad money drives out good").  The lesson also covered the concept of fractional reserve banking and fiat money, highlighting the potential for governments to manipulate the money supply through inflation and currency debasement. The upcoming research paper deadline was emphasized.

**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Homework Review:**
    * Discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of investing in gold and silver coins.
    * Analysis of the US government's seizure of gold in the 1930s as a form of taxation.
    * Explanation of why gold coins are not used in everyday transactions.
    * Analysis of a chart showing inflation and deflation.
    * Explanation of "too much money chasing too few goods" as a cause of inflation.
    * Discussion of bank runs in the 1930s and the government's response (bank holidays).


* **The Nature of Money:**
    * Definition: Anything generally accepted as a means of payment.
    * Functions: medium of exchange, measure of value, store of value.
    * Six Desirable Characteristics: portability, durability, homogeneity, divisibility, constancy (stability of value), intrinsic valuableness.
    * Historical Examples: Salt, rifle cartridges, pine tree shillings, limestone wheels (Yap).
    * Gresham's Law: Bad money drives out good (worthless money circulates while valuable money is hoarded).


* **Types of Money:**
    * Species (metallic coin):  has intrinsic value.
    * Paper Money:  can be fiat money (backed only by government promise) or backed by precious metal reserves.
    * Fractional Reserve Banking: A system where banks loan out a portion of deposited funds, creating a multiple expansion of the money supply.
    * Debasing Currency:  Government actions to reduce the value of currency (e.g., reducing the precious metal content of coins).


* **Economic Concepts:**
    * Inflation:  A general increase in prices caused by an excess of money in circulation.
    * Deflation: A general decrease in prices.


* **Homework:**
    * Read pages 151-153 of the textbook.
    * Answer questions 1, 3, 4 on page 154.
    * Complete economic supplement applications 9A and 9B.
    * Begin writing the final draft of the research paper (due in Lesson 61).


**Definitions/Formulas:**

* **Species:** Metallic coin money (gold, silver).
* **Fiat Money:** Currency not backed by a physical commodity but by the government's promise.
* **Fractional Reserve Banking:** Banking system where only a fraction of deposits is kept in reserve; the rest is available for lending.
* **Inflation:** A general increase in the price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time.
* **Deflation:** A general decrease in the price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time.
* **Gresham's Law:**  Bad money drives out good; debased or less valuable currency will circulate while more valuable currency is hoarded.
* **None explicitly defined.**
