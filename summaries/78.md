**Concise Summary:**

This lesson focuses on the concept of economic externalitiesâ€”the unintended positive or negative consequences of economic actions on third parties not involved in the initial transaction.  The lecture uses examples of international relations (UN intervention, humanitarian aid), environmental issues (global warming, the Kyoto Protocol), and business decisions (oil drilling) to illustrate how externalities can impact various aspects of the economy and the environment. The discussion emphasizes the need for careful consideration of both positive and negative externalities when making economic decisions, particularly on an international scale. The lesson concludes with a homework assignment.


**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Economic Externalities:** Unintended consequences (positive or negative) of economic actions affecting third parties not involved in the initial transaction.
    * **Examples:**  A neighbor's swimming pool (positive: access to pool; negative: noise, light pollution, potential property damage); oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico (positive: lower oil prices; negative: environmental damage).

* **International Relations and Externalities:**
    * **UN Intervention:** The hypothetical scenario of UN intervention in the American Civil War illustrates the potential for unintended negative consequences when international bodies interfere in domestic affairs.
    * **Humanitarian Aid:** The ineffectiveness of large-scale, government-funded aid programs due to dependency and lack of accountability. The importance of private, responsible charity is highlighted.

* **Environmentalism and Externalities:**
    * **Global Warming:** The debate surrounding global warming and the use of scientific data to support differing viewpoints is discussed.
    * **Kyoto Protocol:** The Kyoto Protocol is used as an example of how attempts to address environmental concerns can lead to unintended economic consequences (e.g., carbon credits).


* **Multinational Corporate Decisions and Externalities:** Decisions by large corporations can have significant positive or negative externalities on a global scale.  The need to consider such externalities is emphasized.


* **Homework Assignment:**
    * Read pages 221-225 of "Economic Work and Prosperity."
    * Answer the odd-numbered questions on page 226.


**Definitions/Formulas:**

* **Economic Externality:** An event that has a positive or negative effect on a third party who did not participate in the initial action and whose interests were not considered.
